## Population Prediction using ARIMA Model

This project focuses on predicting the population of the United States using an ARIMA model. The dataset spans from January 1952 to December 2019, providing monthly population data.

### Methodology
- **Data Visualization:** Initially visualized the data, revealing a linearly increasing trend.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Conducted an adfuller test to check stationarity, requiring two differences to achieve stationarity.
- **Model Building:** Utilized ACF and PACF plots to determine AR and MA values for the ARIMA model.
- **Prediction:** Developed the ARIMA model and predicted the population for the last 120 months.
- **Evaluation:** Created visualizations to assess the accuracy of the predictions, demonstrating significant accuracy.

This project offers insights into utilizing ARIMA models for time series data prediction.
